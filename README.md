C++ CSV Parser Example
======================

A simple C++ program for parsing a CSV of crypto-currency values (as of Dec 2017) and calculating their equivelant value in another crypto-currency.

```
Coin Name,Symbol,Value (USD)
Bitcoin,btc,16945.20
Litecoin,ltc,326.29
Ethereum,etc,829.09
Monero,xmr,472.35
Stratis,STRAT,11.47
Tron,trx,0.041147
```

It's pretty basic and was just used to demonstrate some basic coding concepts.
